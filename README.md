# Single-Page-CV

FrontEnd Project [0]

## What I used in index.html

This single-page CV is built with standard web technologie and best practices:

- Clean HTML5 structure with semantic elements for better accessibility and SEO.
- Custom Style using HTML for consistent theming and mobile-first styling.
- Meta tags for responsive viewport and basic SEO.

This keeps the project lightweight, easy to maintain, and focused on a clear, responsive presentation of the CV.
